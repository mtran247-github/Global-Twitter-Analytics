# Twitter Analytics Program

## Overview:
This Python program performs sentiment analysis and geographical analysis on tweets fetched from Twitter using a Tweets input file. It calculates the happiness score based on the sentiment of tweets in different time zones.

## Purpose:
The purpose of this program is to analyze Twitter data to gain insights into the sentiment of tweets and to understand the happiness level in different geographical regions. It can be used by businesses, researchers, and social media managers to gauge public sentiment, monitor brand perception, and identify trends in different time zones.

## Setup and Execution:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required Python library (tweepy) using pip
3. Run the program by executing the following command in the terminal: Follow the on-screen instructions to specify the keyword file and tweet file (keywords.txt and tweets.txt)
7. Try it with your own tweets file and see the results!


## Improvements:
- this was written a few years back and was originally written because I wanted to know if certain geographical locations affected our mental health (living near water vs landlocked states).
- If I were to improve this program to be more up-to-date I'd add:
1. **Twitter Search API**: to fetch real-time tweets based on specific keywords, hashtags, or user mentions to access to a broader range of tweets in real-time
2. **Machine Learning**: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines can learn from a large dataset of labeled tweets to better understand the context, sarcasm, and nuances of language used in tweets as opposed to a couple keywords
3. **OpenWeather API**: to enrich tweet data with additional contextual information, such as weather conditions, location-based events, or demographic data
   
    
## Application:
- **Businesses:** Monitor brand sentiment, analyze customer feedback, and identify trends in different geographical regions.
- **Researchers:** Conduct sentiment analysis on Twitter data to study public opinion and behavior.
- **Social Media Managers:** Gauge audience sentiment, track engagement metrics, and optimize content strategy.

## Conclusion:
The Twitter Analytics Program offers a valuable tool for analyzing Twitter data and gaining insights into public sentiment. By leveraging sentiment analysis and geographical analysis, businesses and researchers can make informed decisions and adapt their strategies to better engage with their audience.
